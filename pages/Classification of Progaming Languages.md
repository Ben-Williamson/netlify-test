# Classification of Programming Languages

***High Level*** - Languages that include functions to make programing easier, for example debuggers and libraries.  They feature better portablity than Low Level Languages.
- These languages require some form of translator.
- examples include python, java, javascript.

***Low Level*** - Hard to read languages which run directly on hardware.  Examples include Assembly and Machine Code.  These languages are hard to debug, making development slow.
- ***Machine Code*** - Binary instructions which represent opperations the computer can carry out.
- ***Assembly*** - Mnemonicsused to represent the binary machine code. 
> Both machine code and assembly instructions are made up of two parts, the operator and the operand.
