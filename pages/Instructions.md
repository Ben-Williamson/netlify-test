# How to use the git system

### Pages on the system can be edited in two ways:
- MD pages can be uploaded directly using Github.
- Changes to code which must be performed using the method outlined below.

### Making Code Changes:
#### *All changes must be tested locally before being pushed to the main branch*
- ***Downloading the code*** - When making changes to the software you must download and make  changes on a local version before pushing any changes to the main site.  To do this use `git clone https://github.com/Ben-Williamson/netlify-test/blob/main/Instructions.md`
- ***Making a commit*** - Once you are happy with the changes you have made you should push the code to the main branch, to do this you need to make a commit.  To add new files use `git add <filename>` then use `git commit *` to add all your changes to the commit.
- ***Pushing changes*** - To push code to the repo use the command `git push`.
